\page Devices Devices

The 'Devices' namespace contains classes that add physical devices (e.g., mice, keyboards, data acquisition, and robots) to simulations. Some devices are always built, while others require specific cmake options to be set (e.g., BUILD_DEVICE_SIXENSE) due to required dependencies that may not exist in all build environments.

Devices with Dependencies:
- \subpage LabJack
- \subpage Leap 
- \subpage MultiAxis
- \subpage Nimble
- \subpage Novint
- \subpage Oculus
- \subpage OpenNI
- \subpage Phantom
- \subpage Sixense
- \subpage TrackIR
